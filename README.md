Simple Gallery
==============

A simple image gallery plugin based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com).

The idea behind this javascript gallery is to be extremely simple. Just a 
simple fade transition between the images and navigation enabled.

There is a lot of gallery plugins for jQuery, but I made this one for two 
reasons:

1. get some basic skill on jQuery plugins development;
2. create a real simple solution for projects that don't require a polished 
solution.

Demo
----

Clone the project and check out the `demo.html` page.

Installation
------------

Include script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts 
somehow else):

    <script src="/path/to/jquery.simple-gallery.js"></script>

Do NOT include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...). The 
file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked in Internet 
Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom 
line: GitHub is NOT a CDN.

Usage
-----

### HTML

The basic HTML sintax is as follows:

    <div class="simple-gallery">
        <figure id="image-1">
            <img src="//placehold.it/1000x400/003366">
        </figure>
        <figure id="image-2">
            <img src="//placehold.it/1000x400/006633">
        </figure>
        <figure id="image-3">
            <img src="//placehold.it/1000x400/336600">
        </figure>
        <figure id="image-4">
            <img src="//placehold.it/1000x400/663300">
        </figure>
        <nav>
            <a href="#image-1">Image 1</a>
            <a href="#image-2">Image 2</a>
            <a href="#image-3">Image 3</a>
            <a href="#image-4">Image 4</a>
        </nav>
    </div>

The HTML for **Simple Gallery** is very flexible, so the only requirement is 
that the links used for navigation contains the anchor for the gallery 
elements (identified by their IDs).

If you use another HTML element to hold the images instead of `<figure>`, just 
let the plugin know that through the options (see below for more information).

### Javascript

If you have the `simple-gallery` class on your gallery container element, you 
don't have to write any Javascript code to make your gallery work. But you 
still can configure the plugin within `data-*` attributes or changing the 
plugin's defaults. See below.

### CSS

This plugin doesn't require any custom CSS to work properly.

Only one class is added to HTML during the execution of the plugin: `current` 
class in the element currently displayed.

### Options

You can define the options by three distinct ways:

1. using `data-*` HTML attributes: `data-interval="8"`;
2. when using the jQuery call to start the gallery, as a hash of parameters to 
`gallery` function: `jQuery('.my-gallery').gallery({ loop : false });`
3. overriding the default settings, before call the jQuery `gallery` function: 
`$.fn.gallery.defaults.elements = 'span';`.

#### tag

If you want to use a different HTML tag to your gallery elements instead of 
`<figure>` define it with the `tag` option:

    {
        tag : 'div'
    }

#### loop

By default the plugin will automatically loop over the elements on document 
ready. You can change this behavior setting the `loop` option to `false`.

#### interval

This option expect a integer number with the amount of seconds between each 
image in the loop. The default value is `5`.
